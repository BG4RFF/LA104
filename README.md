# LA104 Logic Analyser 

This is a firmware fork from the origional firmware.
Sadly this will require building in IAR so I will aim to upload releases fairly often.
I'm using IAR 4.6 locally.

## Features Added / Changed

* Speed up boot screen to minimal time
* Hold K3 and use the A wheel to adjust X pos
* Hold K3 and use the B wheel to adjust time base
* Hold K4 and use the A wheel to move the T1 marker
* Hold K4 and use the B wheel to move the T2 marker
